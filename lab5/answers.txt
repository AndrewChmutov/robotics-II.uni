| what is the role of the transpose layer after input?

Since the input spec of our network is of shape (N, W, H, C) and the ONNX
requires (N, C, W, H), see https://onnx.ai/onnx/operators/onnx__Conv.html#inputs,
the conversion tool has to use Transpose layer.

| what is the role of the GlobalAveragePool layer after the last Concat layer?

GAP, contrary to convolution, does not require parameters, yet it still
aggregates feature maps, and allows to apply Squeeze layer after it in order to
feed it into MatMul layer with only 48x3 weight shape.
