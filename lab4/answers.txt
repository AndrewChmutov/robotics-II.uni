1. What is the size of the input tensor?

float32[1,3,608,608]

2. What do you think, what is the role of the two first convolution layers?

Downsampling, increased receptive field.

3. Look for the output, why does the model concatenate three stacks?

Multiple stacks in the head (a part of YOLO architecture that is the last and
generates outputs) uses concatenation to include all predictions from across
different scales and anchor boxes.
